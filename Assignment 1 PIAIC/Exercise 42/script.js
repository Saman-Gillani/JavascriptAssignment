// Quesion No 42:Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name.
// Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

let magician =["David Copperfield","Doug Henning","Penn & Teller"];
 /*function show_magicians(magiciansNames){
    //console.log(`${magician}`);
    magiciansNames.map((item)=>{
