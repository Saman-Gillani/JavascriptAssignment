// Question 22:Intentional Error: If you havenâ€™t received an array index error in one of your programs yet, try to make one happen. Change an index in one of your programs to produce an index error. 
//Make sure you correct the error before closing the program.
let guestList =["Maria",'Mahnoor','Sundas'];
 //error
guestList[5] ="Fatima";
  console.log(guestList);
  // Resolving error by using A filter function that will filter out all the empty values from our array.
  newGuestList = guestList.filter((item) => item.length > 0);
  console.log(newGuestList);
